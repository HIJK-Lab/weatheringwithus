                The conversation surrounding climate change has become messy, inaccessible, polarised. The immense scale of climate change and _____ the inhabitability of the earth has incited anxiety and induced panic rather than inspire positive action. Guilt tripping, yada yada. Politicised, finger-pointing. Noisy.
                <br><br>

                What if the climate change museum offers a place to quieten down, to heal (actually heal the environment), offers facts without obfuscating it with agenda, represents the collective action of everyone, on a global scale, without scaring, connects us instead of dividing us, situates the individual within the global scale without overwhelming. Offer a neutral ground to discuss, research, plan and act. 
                <br><br>

                The museum functions as a huge, rotating sand clock, with a mechanical armature etching patterns on a circular sandy landscape. The sand is grinded olivine, a green volcanic mineral that is found abundantly in the Earth's subsurface. When sea water meet this mineral, a chemical reaction occurs that pulls carbon dioxide out of the air and the carbon finds its way to the bottom of the sea as the shells and backbones of mollusks and corals, stored as carbon deposits. This process, mineral weathering, is the Earth's natural mechanism to regulate its carbon dioxide and functions as an important carbon sink. 
                <br><br>

                The museum is a landscape of olivine sand with an armature straight across it. The armature contains the programmatic functions of the institution, and as it revolves around the sand-scape, its grooves inscribe data patterns onto the site, forming a large pattern as a whole as seen from above — like a sand mandala. Climate data from all over the world — scientific data, empirical evidence, individual behavioural data, pollution index — feeds into the museum which translates the information into a pattern that represents the collective identity of our actions, our mistakes, our triumphs and our attempts. 
                <br><br>

                The site of the museum is where the Equator intersects the Prime Meridian, at the coordinates 0,0 (a longitude and latitude of zero), a place fictitiously referred to as Null Island. Interestingly, due to errors or bugs in geocoding programmes, information is often erroneously mapped to this null coordinates; the site is a virtual gathering place to where data tends to flow. It seems apt, then, to situate the museum as a data collection point here, out in the sea, belonging to no particular state. As a floating barge, sea water ebbs in and out of the sand-scape, reacting with the olivine sand to capture carbon dioxide out of the air and into the water and eroding the patterns away; the waves itself contributing to the generative 'mandala'.

                A mandala, representing wholeness of the universe, a spiritual tool to aid healing and induce meditation. Part of the architecture of the museum is an aerial camera which is constantly recording the sand-scape from above and transmitting this image live to anyone with an internet access. The real-time image of the sand mandala can be displayed on the wall of people's homes as a digital artwork, a constant reminder of the transitory state of our planet and the impact of our combined efforts.

                Extending the reach of the institution of the museum into the homes and our everyday

                Expanding the entity of 'the museum' as an ecology: data-collecting... 

                Device as building/architecture. 

                Unlike the doomsday clock

                A shared device, not a harbinger of doom, but hope (healing?).
