                Let's talk about climate change. But how should we go about doing so? The conversation surrounding climate change has evolved into a blur of facts and has become increasingly polarised and partisan. That facts themselves have been accused of lying, and of being pessimistic, of inciting panic, and of having a political agenda. 
                What if the climate change museum offers a respite from all this noise, to heal (literally heal the environment), presents facts without obfuscating it with agenda, represents the collective action of everyone on a global scale, unites us instead of dividing us, situates the individual in the bigger picture without overwhelming us? 
                <br><br>

                The museum functions as a huge, rotating sand clock, with a mechanical armature that etches patterns onto a circular sandy landscape. The sand is ground olivine, a green volcanic mineral that is found abundantly in the Earth's subsurface. When seawater meets olivine, a chemical reaction occurs that pulls carbon dioxide out of the air and the carbon finds its way to the bottom of the sea as the shells and backbones of molluscs and corals, stored as carbon deposits. This process, mineral weathering, constitutes one of the Earth's natural mechanism to regulate its carbon dioxide level and functions as an important carbon sink.

                Instead of telling time, this sand device rotates over a 24-hour cycle, inscribing generative data pattern onto the sand-scape, forming a large motif as seen from above, like a sand mandala. Climate data from all over the world – carbon emission, pollution index, behavioural data – feeds into the museum, through a processor that procedurally translates the information into data visualisations that represents the collective fingerprint of our actions, our mistakes, our triumphs and our attempts. The 'hand' of the clock, the armature, spans the diameter of the circular sand-scape. Half of the armature contains the programmatic functions of the museum: galleries, research centres, a cafe. The other half houses the moving mechanisms that engrave the sand: a maze of walls that moves up and down, etching the ground when the walls are down. As such, the configuration of the walls and circulatory path depends on the pattern currently being inscribed, which determines which walls are up or down. As the armature sweeps across the landscape, sand flows in and out of the floor, slowly. Walking through the sand-filled maze becomes a contemplative experience as one weaves around the walls, watching the sand trickling on the ground.

                The site of the museum is where the Equator intersects the Prime Meridian, at the coordinates 0,0 (longitude and latitude of zero), a place fictitiously referred to as Null Island. Interestingly, due to errors or bugs in geocoding programmes, information is often erroneously mapped to this null coordinates. The site is a virtual gathering place where data tends to flow. It seems apt, then, to situate the museum as a data collection point here, out in the sea, belonging to no particular state. As a floating barge, seawater ebbs in and out of the sand-scape, reacting with the olivine sand to capture carbon dioxide out of the air and eroding the patterns away; the waves itself contributing to the generative 'mandala'.
                <br><br>

                The mandala is a symbol for healing. An aerial camera records the sand-scape from above and transmits this image live to anyone with internet access. The real-time image of the sand mandala can be displayed on the wall of people's homes as digital artwork or set as a browser background, a constant reminder of our collective actions and a quiet reflection of the transitory state of our planet. This extends the reach of the institution of the museum into the homes and our everyday, breaking down the boundaries of where the museum starts and ends. 
                <br><br>

                Currently, the global accumulation of the current state of affair is represented by the Doomsday clock. What if, instead, we have a shared device that functions not as a harbinger of doom, but of healing?

                <br>
                Data visualisation of climate data from open-source APIs (Azavea Climate, NOAA, NASA). 
                <br>
                Procedural pattern made with Processing/ P5.js.
